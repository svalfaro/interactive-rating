## **My process**

---

### **Built with**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### **What I learned**

- How to target HTML elements and manipulate via JavaScript.
- Reading subjects and using them in projects are two different things -- HTMLCollections and NodeLists, for example, were put into practice.
- addEventListener was a previous hurdle.

### **Continued development**

- Involve a backend aspect within a project.
